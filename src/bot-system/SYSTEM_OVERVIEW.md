## Core Architecture

### System Components

- **AdvancedBotStrategy.js** - Strategic decision-making engine with win rate tracking
- **HumanLikeGameplayService.js** - Behavioral simulation and natural response patterns  
- **PerformanceBalancer.js** - Win rate analysis and automatic performance adjustment
- **GameplayController.js** - Gameplay orchestration and natural interaction flow
- **BotMatchmakingService.js** - Intelligent bot deployment and queue management

### Technical Features

#### Performance Balancing
- Tracks performance metrics over rolling 10-game windows
- Automatically adjusts bot skill levels to maintain 50% ±5% win rate
- Gradual, undetectable performance modifications
- Multi-factor analysis including trends, consistency, and opponent skill assessment

#### Human-Like Behavior Simulation
- Variable reaction times (800ms-4000ms) based on game context
- Natural mistake patterns including misclicks, hesitation, and memory lapses
- Time-of-day performance variations reflecting human circadian patterns
- Behavioral profiles: casual, competitive, strategic, and inconsistent player types

#### Advanced Strategy System
- Realistic memory retention and forgetting patterns
- Strategic card selection based on position preferences
- Adaptive difficulty scaling based on opponent skill level
- Fatigue modeling for extended gameplay sessions

## Database Schema

### Performance Tracking Tables
- `bot_statistics` - Aggregate performance metrics per bot
- `bot_game_performance` - Individual game session records
- `bot_adjustment_history` - Win rate modification audit trail
- `bot_game_sessions` - Real-time session behavior tracking

### Analytics Capabilities
- Win rate analysis with statistical significance testing
